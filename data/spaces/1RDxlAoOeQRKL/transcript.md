Host: Mic check. 1, 2, 1, 2. Can anyone hear? Hello? Hello? Can anyone hear me? Can you give me some kind of emoji response? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. I've accidentally run this off my laptop rather than my phone, which is not what I normally do. So hopefully, you don't have any dramas here. Can I add some co-hosts to make us more stable? Ash, here you go. Kevin, hello there. Let's get you up as a co-host, too.

Ash: Hello, GM. How's it going?

Kevin: Yeah. That's great. Oh, relief. GM, guys.

Host: Hi, hi, hi. Welcome, welcome, welcome. This is filling up fast, but we'll take a few minutes for more to appear. I ask you just please to retweet the spaces. Let's get as many bums on seats as we possibly can for this.

Kevin: Hey, guys. How are we doing?

Ash: We're doing well. We hear you.

Host: Had a glitch in the matrix then. It said it was in 20 minutes at 10 a.m. on my computer. That might be the me saying, because in the messaging, I've got build a startup in 20 minutes.

Kevin: Oh, sorry. It's kind of, I know, as I was doing this, I was like, hang on, that's people.

Host: I think people are going to, you know, I've just done the discord announcement. I think just get onto your feed and reshare the link. So just get as many bums on seats as we possibly can for this. I think this is crazy alpha. I think we all agree that X402 has unlocked something pretty special, pretty unique, actually kind of once in a lifetime.

Ash: I think if we fast forward a few years, agent to agent commerce will be incredibly sophisticated and quite hard to enter. Today, it's a wide open field and you can access, you know, all the people who are building it at the protocol level by DM.

Kevin: And you won't be able to do that in a few years as well because there'll be agents. So this is this is a moment.

Host: We're very grateful to the guys at Coinbase who are joining us on this call to sort of workshop it and talk about it. It's also a kind of open mic and invited builders from across the ecosystem.

Ash: We're not here to show daydreams. We will talk about what you can be done by daydreams, but it's really we're very focused on banging the drum, build out the category, bring as many people as we can into it, you know, the early adopters to start building.

Kevin: Yeah, man, it's a wide open space right now. I just keep coming back to like, I think I was talking to Shafu the other day, and it's like not really a meme. I mean, it kind of is, but like it's not. The total addressable market for, you know, X402 and HTTP payments is literally the global economy.

Ash: It's, you know, we're kind of in this little bubble right now where we're, you know, we're fooling around on the edge and doing things. But like there's 900 million people currently that use chat apps weekly. And that's probably in four or five years going to be five, six billion.

Kevin: Like the uptake in chat apps is like the fastest uptake of any app like ever. What faster than social media.

Host: And so as soon as those apps and Coinbase has their own MCP now that you can plug in really easily, but it's still, there's still like a slight little barrier to kind of add an MCP.

Ash: But I think that ChatGPT and Claude are about to bake in native wallets. And then so like if you're building in right now in the space, you know, you suddenly have access to 900 million people that are going to be able to call your service, which I just find mind-blowing.

Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I agree. I think that what's happening here, it's not the rise of an app. It's a new user interface. It's as big of a deal as, you know, a new operating system.

Ash: The way that people interface with computers is going to fundamentally shift because of this design change pattern.

Kevin: Yeah. I mean, it has shifted already. Like we're like, I mean, I don't know about you guys. I mean, I'm sure everyone here on the call uses, like just nails agents all day, every day in through either cursor or codecs or, you know, ChatGPT or Claude, whatever the flavor it is, you know, everyone's nailing it all day, every day right now.

Host: And you know, the token usage is just going to go through the roof, continue to. So yeah, it's everyone's behavior has changed in the last two years.

Ash: Just the heads up, it showed that you're having connection error. And when it shows that it's probably like 10, 15 seconds before we get rugged.

Host: Yeah. Well, if we do get rugged, I'll post a new link on the daydreams agents account and get that up and live, but all being well. I've added multiple co-hosts, which tends to, so yeah. Loaf, Eric, I've added you as co-host that tends to make things more robust.

Eric: Hello. Hello there. Excellent.

Host: Okay. Well, we just did a little bit of an intro blurb. I just, yeah. Final question, people just go to your, your Twitter and just retweet the link. Let's get bums on seats for this. It's a pretty Epic opportunity to be in on day one of, you know, pre-agent takeoff.

Eric: I think we're actually at the moment of agent takeoff. I think X402, ERC8004, and obviously A2A and A2P. Those protocols have formed a puzzle of completed a puzzle, which means that the moment for agent takeoff, whether that's a soft takeoff or a hard takeoff, we're going to find out now.

Host: So like what an exciting time to be, to be building in this space.

Kevin: Oh, I'm speaking, bro. They're letting me speak. Yo, yo, yo. Hello. Hello. Hello. Who's, yeah, I did make this a, an open, an open mic thing where people can just wander up.

Host: I think it's, I think maybe just lock that down for now. Let's, let's, let's lock that down. Random people come up and speak. It'd be a shame.

Kevin: Yeah. Let's lock that down. I would love to let's, let's, let's lock it to like everybody here except for Loaf. Don't let Loaf speak.

Host: Okay. So only people who've been invited to speak. Now I'm going to press this button. If it rugs.

Ash: Hey, David, don't press that button. Don't press it. Okay. Just let's, let's, let's readjust. And, and, and let's, let's start hearing from, I think you're having troubles.

Host: Secretive. We've got a few random speakers, not random, but you know, let's, let's keep it on track. And, and let's hear from the, let's hear from programmer and you know, some of the key drivers that have been kind of pushing on this space for the last six months and hear their opinion and about, you know, everything that's going on, because I think, you know I think a good place to start.

Kevin: And, you know, like there's been a few spaces, you know, we've been beating some topics to death. And, you know, which is good because, you know, it's still an emergent thing.

Host: But I think that, you know, what a good place to kind of push on in this space is specifically is like, you know, where we're going from here in terms of like consumer kind of usage and, you know, businesses being built, because really this is like a whole, this is like a new platform to build businesses on, which is really what I'm most excited about.

Ash: And like, you know, there's the crypto element of it. There's the AI element of it. And then there's just like the distribution part of it. And there's these three like converging parts into this kind of stack that just is going to be a rocket ship for adoption and kind of the next generation of entrepreneurs and next type of businesses to appear because these rails just kind of access the entire economy.

Eric: And the, so, you know, that's, that's really where I want to begin. And I think it'd be a good time to, let's, let's, Eric, you know, Eric, for those that don't know, you know, is the kind of creator of X402. And it'd be good to hear is, you know, your thoughts, Eric, on like, you know, what do you want to see most next in the next like six months, you know, come out of this?

Eric: That's a great question. So I'll give you a few thoughts. So what are the problems you have with AI agents today? And I think this is a question that anyone who uses AI should be effectively constantly asking themselves is like, how do these AIs serve me? And how do they, these AIs kind of suck?

Eric: And so I think what you're going to end up seeing is like the emergence of Lego block utility tools, where let's say that you have like an API and it like removes the background for, from an image for you. Previously, like that is not a useful thing to necessarily build because there's, you know, you can open up Photoshop and do it and all these things, but you can't necessarily do that with an AI agent.

Eric: And so you're, you're going to see a lot of like low costs, very single purpose, direct APIs and products form out where the entire like concept is this agent can now pay a cent or 10 cents or whatever it is to access this tool that does like a very specific thing.

Eric: So like background removal of an image might be an issue, might be an example of that where like you have an AI agent, it generates an image and then it can call a service that removes the background of the image in order to create like a nice PNG with transparency.

Eric: Right. And you, you can kind of envision, like you build up enough of these Lego blocks and now you can create atomic workflows from any AI agent or any chat that can compose these things into like novel use cases.

Eric: And so I think that's like access to data. I think it's access to like tools that perhaps didn't serve like a common purpose to build as a business before, but now have an audience with this like pay-per-use paradigm.

Eric: And I think you'll see on the opposite side, more and more interesting venues for agents to be created and for clients of agents to exist. And if you think about like the chat interfaces that you have right now, you, most people in this room have probably used like NAN, but most of the world has not. Right.

Eric: They don't really think of like agentic workflows, they think of like agentic chat. And so I think there's a ton of interesting experimentation to do where you kind of like combine these concepts of ad hoc tools and workflows and allow these agents to like dynamically solve problems that they wouldn't otherwise be able to based on the context that they're given and the tools that are available to them.

Ash: Yeah, that's, I mean, it's touching on that composability part, and anyone that's built software and that's the, this is why we build NPM packages. And this is why we design software in modular ways. So you can be recomposed in, and create whole new things.

Ash: And this, I think originally, if you look back a year, even the way that agents were designed, everything was quite siloed and everyone was kind of building these agents that had their own actions and tools. And then MCP came along and kind of like broadened the kind of composability because it was like the standard to inject kind of actions and tools into your agent.

Ash: And then now come along X.402, which has kind of created the marketplace for the tools. And so now you have the free market deriving the composability and kind of assembling new possibilities and new pathways for agents to solve problems.

Ash: And so, yeah, it's the programming paradigm put into requests and agents.

Eric: Yeah. And I think the thing I'd add to that real quick is, and then I'll let Ash speak because he builds a ton of agents, is the MCP is great for consistently integrating tightly scoped tools into projects because you always know like what the interface to the tool is going to be, but you still have to integrate each MCP tool manually.

Eric: Like you have to add, if you're building a sophisticated agent, like three or four or five MCPs, and then you still don't have like an unlimited set of functionality. Whereas if you combined X.402 and Discovery, what you get is a theoretically infinite set of tools that an agent can now leverage.

Eric: I would just wanted to add to Eric's comment. So like, since this was like a startup idea space, which got me super pumped for any builder listening, like if I was to do something like this, I would start by going into a SEO site. So like SMRush or Ahrefs, and I would type a keyword that are for microservices.

Eric: So I would just type like converter. And then from that, I would find out what's the most used converters. So for example, PNG to JPEG, background removal, as Eric mentioned, or like PNG to Fabricon, like things that are like commonly used, and a SEO tool would like flag all of those to you.

Eric: And I would just take all those microservices and create endpoints for them that could be called and used with microtransactions. And you can literally build an empire of that.

Ash: Yeah, a hundred percent. That's exactly my thinking. It's, you know, decomposing these existing tools into these little micro businesses. And then you just have, yeah, as you said, you have an empire of them, and you just monitor them.

Ash: And you know, you can kind of like, now you have like traceability, so you can monitor the P&L exactly. You can see how much money they're costing in inference, and you can see how much money they're bringing in.

Ash: So you can, like any, I like to think of them as like, you know, like individual little business units, these agents, or endpoints. I mean, they don't even have to be agents, to be honest. They're just like, you just have to create something that an agent is willing to pay for, or a human is, or it doesn't have to be a full-blown, you know, they can just literally be anything.

Eric: Yeah, I think that's the key thing, right? Is like, you end up with just things that are useful, right? Like how many times do you search? I know for me, like I search compound interest calculator all the time, and there's like this random website that I consistently use to just like compute what like the forward value of compound interest is.

Eric: And like an AI agent may or may not be able to do a like forward compound interest calculation, and I'd probably rather it pay like a cent to do that calculation than for it to just kind of guess and be wrong if I'm doing like some detailed report in cloud or something.

Eric: And so you end up with this, with modern infra, you end up with this like, that could be a lambda, literally just like a JavaScript path function, and with the REST API in front of it.

Eric: And you as a developer, your costs is like the invocation cost of a lambda, which is like a couple hundredths or thousandths of a cent. And every time it's called, you make, you charge a tenth of a cent or one cent, and your margin is basically the difference between the cost of hosting the lambda and the amount that you get paid per invocation, which is kind of like a crazy business model.

Ash: For the, for the discovery right now, I haven't used the bazaar much yet, but like what would like say, say if my agent wants to remove a background, what would like help it choose service A as opposed to service B, so that whoever's like thinking of creating these can like keep that in mind? Like what's the SEO, I guess, for the bazaar?

Eric: That's a great question. I think this is an active space that people are experimenting on. I actually just had a call with Davide from 804 like an hour ago about this. I think ultimately like you're, we just need to play with a bunch of mechanisms there.

Eric: This is why like our list endpoint and like the spec of the bazaar says that facilitators should be just giving away the discovery information in bulk for free, because we actually want exactly what happened with X-Force to scan to happen, where we want these kind of like marketplaces and aggregators to just try different ways of surfacing the information, so that people can try, you know, different recommender algorithms and different ways of tracking stats.

Eric: And I could imagine you even have like, you know, pay per call recommendation systems or recommender agents that you say like, hey, I'm trying to accomplish this workflow, what are the best tools for me? And you pay it a cent and it says like, hey, based on your, what you're trying to accomplish, here are like six tools that may suit your needs.

Eric: But I don't think we understand like what that paradigm is going to look like quite yet, and so the thing to do is maximize for experimentation and iteration.

Ash: Yeah, it's a bit like pre-Google, when everyone was trying to rank websites for usefulness, and Google came up with PageRank, which was the kind of the key, you know, algorithm that they created, which was incredibly, which was way better than everything else, which is why, you know, Google is what Google is.

Ash: But yeah, I think those exact metrics of, you know, how you rank services, I think it's starting to emerge, you know, what to look for, but, you know, what's going to happen when there's millions of these things, they have to be indexed, you know, effectively, they have to be ranked effectively, at like a really rapid pace, and be really up to date.

Ash: But yeah, there's probably going to be layers and layers, as in, you don't hit a service, you'd hit an agent that does the search, that is optimized for that. So there's abstraction layers there.

Eric: Yeah, one thing that I'd add to that is the eval component, and so it's a little bit different than just surfacing information on Google, where you're just trying to find the most relevant information.

Eric: You want to make sure the API is reliable, and that the user consistently gets a response, and that that response is useful with regards to how the user, you know, intended their prompt.

Eric: And so I think eval is kind of another really important aspect when thinking about discovery with Dex 402.

Ash: Just on that too, there's the style of kind of having your favorites. So to Eric's point earlier, where he goes to that compound interest calculator all the time, you can imagine agents doing the same thing, where they have a short list of bookmarked or favorited tools, saying like, hey, every time you ask me for something related to compound interest, this one works for me. So just keep using this, don't go searching.

Eric: Yeah, no, totally. And like, as we build up more sophisticated agent frameworks, those are like exactly the things that we should be accounting for, right? Is that like, actually, you should have like a tool, local tool cache that your agent can add to that says like, oh, this actually worked.

Eric: And that's like probably part of your state, similar to your system prompt or your message history is just like your, you know, your collection of receipts, and like what services were good.

Eric: And I think the idea, like, you know, top level idea of EIP 8004, which I was one of the co-signers of is like, you should then like take those receipts and put them on chain. And so other people can start to benefit from like, the reputation that other people have.

Eric: I think there's like a ton of difficulty and like, how do you actually make that a reality of like shared reputation, and you can have like, adversarial effects of, you know, a competitor downvoting all your products, similar to that they can and Google Maps, right?

Eric: Like if you're, you know, local hot dog stand A, you're incentivized to go and rate local hot dog stand B, one star, but we should like, this is like the, you know, play around and see what works and see what's valuable.

Eric: And this is why in v2, we introduced extensions, right? Is like, make it easier for people to iterate and try new stuff that are adjacent. And if there's a clear model that becomes dominant, that really works, we'll look to enshrine it more permanently into the x402 spec.

Ash: Yeah. And I think on top of that, you have, you don't just have humans that can spoof, you have agents and agents work 24 seven, and there's going to be millions of them. So yeah, it's going to be definitely a problem in that space, reputation wise.

Ash: One thing on that too, is that there's human understandable reputation, and then the topic of pain drain has come up multiple times, but that means that you can kind of have superior to human reputations or reputation systems where it can kind of surface problems that are probably cognitively too heavy for us to understand.

JRP: Yo, what's up, everybody? It's great to be on here. And also great to see a whole bunch of familiar faces. Obviously, x402 has blown up over the last couple of months. And I know that Love has talked about gaming.

JRP: Generally speaking, there's two industries that adopt technology quicker than really anything else. I'm curious if there's been any gaming conversations here and any interesting gaming examples that people have seen.

JRP: It feels like gaming can be like a resource game where agents are helping you get there, right? And yeah, very curious to see how those interfaces look like, especially making it much easier now with x402.

Host: Well, JRP, are you a plant? Because you've just asked the question that could unlock a two hour long Love dialogue here. So be punchy on this one, Love.

Kevin: Oh, yeah. I'll just, I mean, I'd say we're actually all in a giant MMO right now talking to our chat apps. And these x402 endpoints are just the next part of the game. So it's, you know, we're in the free market now and our agents are in the free market.

Kevin: But in terms of like literal video games, I see, actually, I was actually, like about three months ago, I was actually experimenting with x402 bridge to just kind of onboard people into an on-chain game. I didn't really quite eventuate it.

Kevin: But I think it's a good onboarding technique from people that aren't in crypto at all into a potential game as well, wherever that can be. It could even be like into an arcade or it can be directly into an on-chain game, so they don't even have to have gas.

Kevin: Yeah, so yeah, I think there's a lot of scope. I haven't thought about a specific, you know, actually using x402 as part of the gameplay. But I'm sure there's might be a bit of a roundabout way. You kind of want to get the money there and then maybe use it. But yeah, I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of exploration. But yeah.

Eric: I think the comment I'd make on gaming, right, is like everyone has thought that different crypto tokens and different NFTs and all these things would be like great in-game currency for a long time.

Eric: But it hasn't really been super clear, like how do you actually materialize that? And there's because of gas, because of like interoperability, because of all these things. Like what does your game server actually look like is a non-trivial question.

Eric: Like is each, are you embedding a wallet into like each instance of the game, all these things. Whereas if you, I think people underestimate, it is non-trivially easier to add a signer to an application than it is to add a wallet that actually can do RPC and has gas in order to form transactions.

Kevin: Exactly. Yeah. And this is onboarding. Exactly.

Eric: Yeah. And so now you could like have in-game currency, right, where you put like an embedded wallet, you know, either CDPs or anyone else's into your game and then you give them in-game currency and then they just can sign and then move the funds.

Eric: And the paying for something is like a post to your game server, or you can even like encode the x402 data as like into like the UDP requests your server's already doing, right. And like it just helps answer a bunch of questions and if anyone else wants to latch on to that same in-game currency, they can just follow the same patterns.

Kevin: Yeah. And that's the biggest challenge, you know, as speaking from first experience of building on-chain games for a long time is the onboarding is still just like flaky.

Kevin: And so when these rails start to exist more and signers are in more common, then well that's just another scope of getting, you know, a whole nother distribution channel into your game, which is never a bad thing.

Ash: What I'm thinking is like what would the gas cost be for the facilitator, like with what A16 saying is going to be trillions of dollar economy, like what would be the gas cost when it's like trillion a dollar and who can afford to cover that and what would be their incentive?

Eric: Well, that's the way you design your business model. So like your game model should be generating more, you know, more income than the gas cost to service that player.

Ash: Yeah, Ash has been watching me manually top up the CDP facilitator for a week now and is like, has, you know, scars about how much it's been costing. But I think the assumption you need to make is like the economic model of the facilitator, like probably facilitators aren't going to be free forever.

Eric: They're going to have like some economic relationship with the server. What that is like market should probably decide. But the, you also have to assume that like gas costs for all these chains are going to trend lower and lower and lower and you're not, you're going to have fewer and fewer spikes.

Ash: Go for it.

Eric: I was just going to say that's a good topic to just kind of push on next is the whole facilitator thing. Because I think, you know, a lot of people in the, you know, new people into the kind of ecosystem don't quite grok exactly, you know, how this all works.

Eric: And so, you know, to anyone that's new in the space, I'll just give a quick, you know, 30 seconds is, you know, in any explorer two transaction right now, you have the buyer and the seller. I can still hear him.

Eric: So you have the buyer and the seller, and then you have a third party called the facilitator and the buyer basically just sends a signed request. The seller accepts it. And then the seller forwards it to the facilitator.

Eric: And then the facilitator, which is another wallet, settles that transaction. And that transaction obviously is the, you know, cost gas. And so there's a gas element to the equation, but it's not being paid by the buyer or the seller.

Eric: And so that's the kind of new thing. And I guess the, you know, I'm trying to wrestle with like, you know, like, like, I mean, facilitators to me feel a bit more just like a commodity. And, you know, you're kind of as a business, you kind of want to run your own anyway, for uptime.

Eric: And I didn't see like, a huge, you don't necessarily benefit in, I guess, giant, like when the, like facilitators. But you know, I guess it's an emerging topic. I mean, it'd be good to hear what you think.

Eric: I think Eric just cut out or anyone who's got their hands up that wants to talk on that topic. Cause I think it's a good topic to push on right now.

Ash: Yeah. Eric's trouble, especially bringing him back up. But no, I think I'm kind of with him. Like once, once he gets to the point that it's not going to be free anymore, there's probably going to be like subscription services that emerge that you could like pay someone to handle it.

Ash: Cause of course, like there's a lot of things you could do by yourself, but we all pay for things because we want it done for us as opposed to like us handling everything. And I think that's where they will come in.

Ash: And what would be like super interesting is like what kind of like on-chain products emerge from that, where perhaps you're as a facilitator, don't have all the costs covered upfront by yourself, but you kind of open a liquidity type pool where people could like put their money in and kind of earn yield on the subscription services you're providing for, for the buyers and sellers.

Eric: Yeah. Yeah. That was like kind of the whole point. When I designed like facilitators as a concept is make them a commodity so that you have all sorts of different markets emerge.

Eric: And that's why like half the GitHub comments I leave there are like this ad state and removes portability of facilitators, which would result in lock-in. And cause yeah, you should totally be able to like run your own.

Eric: I think most people don't realize like XCORO 2RS, which has been doing a ton of traffic is fully open source and Apache 2 licensed. You can just run XCORO 2RS yourself if you really wanted to.

Eric: And the, but I do think you'll actually see like less than gas cost facilitators where like the facilitators actually is covering some portion of the total gas costs and then monetizing on the backend through monetizing their discovery.

Eric: And you can imagine like all these different models where you can have subsidized gas based on the operator of a facilitator capturing value at another point in the stack. But again, I think we're in the like play around with stuff era.

Host: I'm just going to put my foot on the ball a little bit here. And, and I see that Sawyer and Binji have had their hands up for a long time. So I've got to get those guys to speak.

Host: Then afterwards, I want to go back to the roots of this spaces, which is, okay, so we've got people sort of buzzed on the idea of API and API endpoints as businesses that will serve agents going forward.

Host: And the scale of, you know, of one person being able to create, you know, billion dollar businesses in their underpants at home. So we'll come back to, we'll come back to like, how do you actually get off zero and start building agents?

Host: And I'm getting some connection issues. I don't know if people can still hear me.

Kevin: I can hear you.

Host: Yeah. I don't know if it was Binji or Sawyer, please go ahead.

Sawyer: Hey, what's up? Honestly, so I'm just here to kind of like, see what people are building and stuff. But I did, I've done a lot of thinking over the past couple of days, speaking to a variety of projects, like, it just feels like this really cool convergence, right?

Sawyer: Right now, we have a lot of people very interested in privacy, we have a lot of people really interested in X.402, AI, etc. You're seeing things happen in the robotics world in real life.

Sawyer: It's like, wait, all of this is becoming real, this crazy future is becoming real. I've also spent a lot of time speaking to people in the credit space and the DeFi on-chain credit space.

Sawyer: So I kind of wanted to come up here to just like, an idea. And I'm curious if this resonates, you know, like, as this evolves, like, part of our job within the EF, etc. is like, let's actually steward builders and let's help builders get connected with the right ideas and potentially with the right ways to build those ideas and whatnot.

Sawyer: So here's just like, a little thought rant, if that's cool with you guys. And I'm curious if that resonates with this group here, as a way that we can like, almost like talk about X.402 to new audiences, especially people in DeFi who may currently be like, okay, like, this is an AI thing.

Sawyer: Like, that's in the AI side of crypto. But like, the more time I spend here, the more I'm like, wait a minute, like, this is quite literally everything. Like, this is quite literally the upgrade of the financialization of the world broadly, to come all online. And it's a key part of it, it feels like.

Sawyer: So yeah, I just wanted to run something by you guys, pretty much. That's okay. It's a long prelude for it. But yeah.

Host: Let's hear it.
